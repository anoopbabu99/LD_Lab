The only building blocks that you can use are NAND gates and the composite gates that you have
created on top of them. 

The only tool that you required for this assignment is the ModelSim-Intel FPGA StarterEdition. 

All the logic functions should be implemented using Verilog HDL in the given order.

Design only Gate-Level Modeling (Structural Modeling) for the implementation.
